# Hey there 👋, I'm Olivier

I'm a **frontend developer** who enjoys building clean, reliable, and thoughtful user experiences.  
Trained at [42 School](https://42lyon.fr/), I've worked with **React**, **React Native**, and **TypeScript** to create performant and scalable web and mobile applications.

💡 I like to explore how things work from UI interactions to backend integrations and I’m always looking for ways to write better, clearer code.
